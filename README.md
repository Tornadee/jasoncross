# "Jasoncross"
For the Jasoncross Chrome Extension, developed by Jason

This is my original code for the Chrome Extension "Jasoncross," which is used by many students in my school.
It is a grade sharing system, where this chrome extension automatically extracts information from "Veracross"
and shows collectively to other students who use this system. The system works while maintaining complete
anonymity from the student's side. Jasoncross is fully incorporated with server-side database, which receives
data via Ajax. The database entry does not include student's name, or school ID number. Instead, it uses a
randomly generated 15-char long text to prevent duplicate entries from the same student.
